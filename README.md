# JSON_Parser
As part of my internship at CodSoft, I contributed to the development of a JSON Data Modification Tool. This C++ application was designed to streamline the process of reading, modifying, and saving JSON data, with a particular emphasis on theme customization.

Key Contributions:

Design & Implementation: Developed a C++ application utilizing STL containers like std::unordered_map and std::pair for efficient data handling. JSON Handling: Integrated the nlohmann::json library to facilitate JSON parsing and manipulation, ensuring compatibility and ease of use. Modern C++ Practices: Employed C++17 features to enhance code efficiency and maintainability. Error Handling & File Operations: Implemented robust error handling and file operation mechanisms, providing a reliable tool for managing complex data systems. This project highlights my proficiency in C++ development and my ability to apply modern practices and libraries to real-world challenges.
